We have designed a Voice-Controlled Obstacle Avoiding Robot with the help of Arduino and can be controlled by Bluetooth Also. In short, it is an Arduino based obstacle avoiding + voice control + Bluetooth control Robot.

The smart rover is a versatile robotic platform equipped with Bluetooth and voice control capabilities. The obstacle avoidance mechanism, facilitated by sensors, enables the smart rover to navigate autonomously, avoiding collisions with objects in its path.

The smart rover presents a promising solution for robotics enthusiasts and educators seeking an accessible and engaging platform for exploring concepts of robotics, automation, and artificial intelligence.

Utilizing an Arduino Uno microcontroller, it offers a user-friendly interface enabling remote control via Bluetooth connectivity from a smartphone or other compatible devices. Additionally, the integration of voice control enhances accessibility and convenience in operating the robot.
